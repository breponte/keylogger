# Special Keys

## Context

This keylogger project is for educational and exploration purposes, and is not required to be comprehensive. There are approximately [140 special keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes), which is too much effort for minimal improvement.

## Decision

It is only necessary to include the most used special keys, therefore my decision is to include the following special keys:
- Spacebar
- Enter
- Shift
- Backspace
- Tab
- Control
- Alt
- Caps lock
- Delete
- Escape
- Left mouse button
- Right mouse button

## Status

**ACCEPTED by Brandon Reponte**

## Consequences

The keylogger is not comprehensive and not completely ready for professional use, but that is not the main goal. Through this decision, the definition of DONE is a lot closer, which saves time and ~~money~~ by cutting back on features as according to the iron triangle.

## Conclusion

Achieving the primary essence of this project, being exploration in the field of cybersecurity, does not require a comprehensive product, especially if the extra features are theoretically easy to implement and therefore a diminishing return on investment.
