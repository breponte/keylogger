# Keylogger

**This keylogger is for educational and exploration purposes only**

The keylogger is designed to run in the background and output every key pressed by the user secretly to the ```logged.txt``` file in ```source```. It utilizes the [Windows API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list) in order to track key strokes. Press ```[ESCAPE]``` key in order to prematurely exit the program. The program only works for a select few special keys that are mostly used in everyday typing.
