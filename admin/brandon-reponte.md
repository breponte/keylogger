# About Me

My name is Brandon Reponte and I am a 3rd year UCSD student studying computer science. I enjoy to play board games and learn/improve every day.

## Short-term Goals

My short-term goals are to:
- Explore in the field of computer science and discover which specialization I want to commit towards.
- Successfully enroll in UCSD's CSE BS/MS program.
- Get an intership in computer science.
- Get a tech job out of college (internship will help towards this goal).
- Explore in Electrical Engineering (self-teach).

## Long-term Goals

In the future I would want to work in a startup, ideally one of my own. I believe I need experience in the industry to best create one, so first I want to get as much practical experience I can in my 20s.
